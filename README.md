# Fraud Detection using Data Sampling Methods

---

## Project Background

The events of frauds are growing increasingly day by day and are more targeted towards banks and businesses. A solution to this is the implementation of fraud detection system. However,the datasets are very imbalanced which can lead to misclassifications of transaction due to the lack of information of the minority class. In this paper we will be utilizing the imbalanced dataset, Synthetic Financial Dataset for Fraud Detection from Kaggle to improve the classification accuracy of the minority class by using different sampling methods. Three supervised machine learning algorithms are also used to assess the performance of the classification accuracy across all sampling methods. The classification performance will be measured using precision, recall, F-measure, and area under precision recall curve (PRC) on the same testing dataset. We demonstrate that resampling data, particularly SMOTE will increase the accuracy of the classification on the minority class across all classifiers.
